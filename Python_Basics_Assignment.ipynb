        "   print(my_string)  # Output: hello\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Differences\n",
        "1. **Modifiability**:\n",
        "   - Mutable: Can be changed in place (e.g., lists, dictionaries).\n",
        "   - Immutable: Cannot be changed in place; operations that seem to modify them actually create new objects (e.g., tuples, strings).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Performance**:\n",
        "   - Mutable objects can be more efficient in terms of memory and performance for large datasets since they don’t require creating new objects for modifications.\n",
        "   - Immutable objects are typically safer in concurrent programming because they cannot change state unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Use Cases**:\n",
        "   - Use mutable objects when you need to maintain and update data frequently.\n",
        "   - Use immutable objects when you want to ensure that data remains constant and unchangeable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "Understanding the distinction between mutable and immutable objects is fundamental in Python, as it affects how you manage data and the behavior of your programs."

        "\n",
        "Type casting in Python refers to converting a variable from one data type to another. This is often necessary when you want to perform operations on different data types or when you want to ensure a variable is in the appropriate format.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Type Casting\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Implicit Type Casting (Automatic Casting)**:\n",
        "   Python automatically converts one data type to another without explicit instructions. This usually happens when mixing types in an operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   a = 5        # int\n",
        "   b = 2.0      # float\n",
        "   result = a + b  # a is implicitly converted to float\n",
        "   print(result)  # Output: 7.0\n",
        "   print(type(result))  # Output: <class 'float'>\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Explicit Type Casting**:\n",
        "   You manually convert a variable from one type to another using built-in functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Examples**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Converting to Integer**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     num_str = \"10\"\n",
        "     num_int = int(num_str)\n",
        "     print(num_int)  # Output: 10\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Converting to Float**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",

        "     num_float = float(num_int)\n",
        "     print(num_float)  # Output: 5.0\n",
        "     print(type(num_float))  # Output: <class 'float'>\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",

        "     print(type(num_str))  # Output: <class 'str'>\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Important Considerations\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Loss of Data**: When casting from a float to an int, the decimal part is truncated.\n",

        "  num_float = 5.7\n",
        "  num_int = int(num_float)\n",
        "  print(num_int)  # Output: 5\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Invalid Conversions**: Attempting to convert incompatible types (like converting a string that doesn't represent a number) will raise an error.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  invalid_str = \"hello\"\n",
        "  try:\n",
