        "3.\tUsing Step:\n",

        "\n",
        "Lists in Python are versatile and widely used data structures. Here are some key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Ordered Collection**\n",
        "   - Lists maintain the order of elements. Items can be accessed by their index.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Mutable**\n",
        "   - Lists can be modified after creation. You can add, remove, or change elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Dynamic Size**\n",
        "   - Lists can grow and shrink in size. You can add or remove elements without needing to specify the size in advance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Heterogeneous Elements**\n",
        "   - Lists can contain elements of different data types, including integers, strings, and even other lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Supports Duplicate Values**\n",
        "   - Lists can have multiple occurrences of the same value.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Built-in Methods**\n",
        "   - Python lists come with a variety of built-in methods, such as `append()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, and `reverse()`, making them easy to manipulate.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **List Comprehensions**\n",
        "   - Python supports concise syntax for creating lists using list comprehensions, enabling easy and readable transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **Nested Lists**\n",
        "   - Lists can contain other lists, allowing for multi-dimensional data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s a quick example illustrating some of these features:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Creating a list\n",

        "### Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Unordered Collection**:\n",
        "   - Sets do not maintain any order. The elements are stored in a way that does not guarantee a specific sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Unique Elements**:\n",
        "   - Sets automatically remove duplicate values, ensuring that each element is unique.\n",

        "3. **Mutable**:\n",
        "   - Sets can be modified after creation; you can add or remove elements.\n",

        "4. **Dynamic Size**:\n",
        "   - Sets can grow and shrink in size as you add or remove elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Supports Mathematical Operations**:\n",
        "   - Sets support operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, making them useful for mathematical tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **No Indexing or Slicing**:\n",
        "   - Since sets are unordered, you cannot access elements by index or slice them.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Set Creation\n",

        "6. Discuss the use cases of tuples and sets in Python programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples and sets in Python serve distinct purposes due to their unique properties. Here are their primary use cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Use Cases for Tuples\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Immutable Data Structures**:\n",
        "   - **Use Case**: When you need a collection of items that should not change, such as coordinates or fixed configuration settings.\n",
        "   - **Example**: Representing geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude).\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     coordinates = (34.0522, -118.2437)  # Los Angeles\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Returning Multiple Values from Functions**:\n",
        "   - **Use Case**: When a function needs to return multiple values, tuples provide a straightforward way to package them together.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     def get_person_info():\n",
        "         return (\"Alice\", 30)\n",
        "\n",
        "     name, age = get_person_info()\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Unpacking**:\n",
        "   - **Use Case**: Tuples allow easy unpacking, which can make your code cleaner and more readable.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     point = (3, 4)\n",
        "     x, y = point  # x = 3, y = 4\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Used as Dictionary Keys**:\n",
        "   - **Use Case**: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries due to their immutability, while lists cannot.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     location_data = {}\n",
        "     location_data[(34.0522, -118.2437)] = \"Los Angeles\"\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Data Integrity**:\n",
        "   - **Use Case**: When you want to ensure that a collection of data remains unchanged, such as fixed records or data points.\n",
        "   - **Example**: Storing RGB color values.\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     color_rgb = (255, 0, 0)  # Red\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Use Cases for Sets\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Removing Duplicates**:\n",
        "   - **Use Case**: When you need to ensure a collection has only unique elements, such as filtering user inputs or data from a database.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     items = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n",
        "     unique_items = set(items)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Membership Testing**:\n",
        "   - **Use Case**: Sets provide efficient O(1) average-time complexity for membership tests, making them ideal for scenarios where you frequently check for existence.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     allowed_users = {\"alice\", \"bob\", \"charlie\"}\n",
        "     if \"dave\" in allowed_users:\n",

        "         print(\"Access denied\")\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Mathematical Operations**:\n",
        "   - **Use Case**: Sets support operations like union, intersection, and difference, which are useful in mathematical computations and data analysis.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     set_a = {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "     set_b = {2, 3, 4}\n",
        "\n",
        "     print(set_a & set_b)  # Intersection: {2, 3}\n",
        "     print(set_a | set_b)  # Union: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Storing Unique Items**:\n",
        "   - **Use Case**: When the order of items is not important, and you want to ensure uniqueness, such as tracking unique event IDs or tags.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     event_ids = set()\n",
        "     event_ids.add(101)\n",
        "     event_ids.add(102)\n",
        "     event_ids.add(101)  # Duplicate, won't be added\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Data Analysis**:\n",
        "   - **Use Case**: Sets can be used to analyze and manipulate datasets, especially when dealing with large data where duplicates can skew results.\n",
        "   - **Example**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     sales_data = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004}\n",
        "     returns_data = {1003, 1005}\n",
        "\n",
        "     # Unique sales after returns\n",
        "     final_sales = sales_data - returns_data  # {1001, 1002, 1004}\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Tuples**: Ideal for immutable data, returning multiple values, and using as dictionary keys.\n",
        "- **Sets**: Best for ensuring uniqueness, membership testing, and performing mathematical set operations.\n",

        "### Importance of Immutable Keys\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hashability**:\n",
        "   - Dictionary keys are hashed to create an index for the value they map to. Immutable objects have a consistent hash value, while mutable objects can change their value and, consequently, their hash. If a mutable object were allowed as a key, it could lead to inconsistent behavior when retrieving or modifying the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Integrity**:\n",
        "   - Using immutable keys ensures that the mapping between keys and values remains stable. This helps maintain data integrity because once a key is added, it cannot be changed, preventing accidental overwrites or deletions.\n",
        "\n",
