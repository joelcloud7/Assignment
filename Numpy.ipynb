        "1.  Explain the purpose and advantages of NumPy in scientific computing and data analysis. How does it enhance Python's capabilities for numerical operations?\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a core library in the Python ecosystem for numerical computing and data analysis. It provides powerful tools to work with arrays, matrices, and numerical data, which are essential in fields like scientific computing, machine learning, data science, and engineering. Below is an overview of its purpose, advantages, and how it enhances Python’s capabilities for numerical operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose of NumPy in Scientific Computing and Data Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Efficient Array Operations**:\n",
        "   NumPy introduces the `ndarray` (n-dimensional array) object, which allows for efficient storage and manipulation of large datasets. These arrays can be multidimensional (e.g., 1D, 2D, 3D, etc.), making it ideal for representing vectors, matrices, and tensors.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Numerical Computations**:\n",
        "   NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical and statistical functions that can be applied directly to arrays. These include basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), as well as more advanced operations like matrix multiplication, linear algebra operations, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Interfacing with Other Libraries**:\n",
        "   NumPy arrays serve as the backbone for other libraries in the scientific computing ecosystem (such as SciPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn). These libraries often rely on NumPy arrays for high-performance computation and data manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages of NumPy\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Speed and Efficiency**:\n",
        "   - **Vectorization**: NumPy allows for vectorized operations, which means you can perform element-wise operations on entire arrays without needing to write explicit loops. This reduces the overhead of Python's for-loops and results in much faster execution, especially for large datasets.\n",
        "   - **C-based implementation**: NumPy is implemented in C, which gives it a significant speed advantage over standard Python lists when performing numerical operations. Operations on NumPy arrays are thus executed much faster than equivalent operations on Python lists.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Memory Efficiency**:\n",
        "   NumPy arrays are more memory efficient than native Python lists. They use contiguous blocks of memory, which reduces the overhead associated with Python’s dynamic list objects. This is particularly important when working with large datasets, where memory usage can become a bottleneck.\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Convenient Syntax**:\n",
        "   The API provided by NumPy is easy to use and closely mirrors the structure of mathematical expressions. You can perform complex operations with just a few lines of code. For instance, matrix multiplication, element-wise operations, and broadcasting can be done intuitively using simple syntax.\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **Multidimensional Array Support**:\n",
        "   While Python lists are inherently one-dimensional, NumPy provides support for multi-dimensional arrays (e.g., 2D matrices, 3D tensors). This feature is crucial in fields like linear algebra, where matrices and tensors are commonly used for representing data and mathematical objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Broad Functionality**:\n",
        "   NumPy offers a large collection of mathematical functions and operations, including:\n",
        "   - Linear algebra functions (e.g., `dot`, `inv`, `eig`).\n",
        "   - Statistical functions (e.g., `mean`, `std`, `var`).\n",
        "   - Fourier transforms (`fft`).\n",
        "   - Random number generation (`random`).\n",
        "   - Optimized aggregate operations like `sum`, `prod`, `min`, `max`.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Broadcasting**:\n",
        "   NumPy supports broadcasting, which allows you to perform operations on arrays of different shapes in a way that makes sense. For example, you can add a scalar to an array, or even add two arrays of different shapes, as long as their dimensions are compatible. This is a powerful feature that simplifies working with arrays of different shapes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Interoperability with Other Tools**:\n",
        "   NumPy is highly compatible with other scientific libraries. For instance, Pandas builds on NumPy to provide data structures like Series and DataFrame, which are designed for handling labeled and time-series data. SciPy and scikit-learn also rely heavily on NumPy for numerical processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How NumPy Enhances Python's Capabilities for Numerical Operations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Optimized Performance**:\n",
        "   Without NumPy, Python's built-in data structures (like lists) are inefficient for numerical computing because they are general-purpose and lack optimization for large-scale numerical tasks. NumPy arrays, on the other hand, are specifically designed for numerical operations, providing a significant performance boost.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Expressiveness and Readability**:\n",
        "   Python is known for its readable and concise syntax. NumPy extends this ease of use to numerical computations by allowing you to express complex mathematical operations in simple and natural syntax. This makes writing, understanding, and debugging code more straightforward.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Cross-Platform**:\n",
        "   NumPy is cross-platform and can be used on various operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) with minimal setup. It can also integrate with high-performance computing tools and libraries, enabling its use in scalable computing environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Interfacing with Low-Level Languages**:\n",
        "   NumPy arrays can be interfaced with low-level languages like C, C++, or Fortran, enabling the use of performance-critical code without sacrificing Python’s high-level simplicity. You can write custom C extensions that interact with NumPy arrays for highly optimized computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Simplifying Complex Tasks**:\n",
        "   Tasks that would typically require complex algorithms in other languages can be simplified with NumPy's array manipulation functions. For instance, solving systems of linear equations, eigenvalue problems, and performing numerical optimization can all be done using concise NumPy code, eliminating the need for writing low-level algorithms from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example: Using NumPy for a Basic Calculation\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s a simple example of using NumPy for matrix multiplication, a common operation in scientific computing:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import numpy as np\n",
        "\n",
        "# Define two 2D arrays (matrices)\n",

        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy is a critical tool for numerical computing in Python, providing speed, efficiency, and a rich set of mathematical functions. By optimizing the performance of numerical operations and simplifying the syntax for complex tasks, it makes Python a powerful language for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific research. Whether you're working with small datasets or large-scale numerical simulations, NumPy enhances Python's capabilities to handle sophisticated numerical tasks effectively.\n"

        "2. Compare and contrast np.mean() and np.average() functions in NumPy. When would you use one over the other?\n",
        "\n",
        "In NumPy, both `np.mean()` and `np.average()` are used to compute the average of elements in an array, but they have some differences in functionality and flexibility. Here's a detailed comparison of the two:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Functionality:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`np.mean()`**:\n",
        "  - This function simply computes the arithmetic mean (average) of the elements along the specified axis.\n",
        "  - It does not take any additional arguments for weighing the elements.\n",
        "  - Syntax: `np.mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=False)`\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Example:**\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  import numpy as np\n",
        "  arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
        "  mean_value = np.mean(arr)\n",
        "  print(mean_value)  # Output: 3.0\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`np.average()`**:\n",
        "  - `np.average()` computes the weighted average of the elements along the specified axis. By default, it computes the arithmetic mean (like `np.mean()`), but it can also take an optional `weights` argument to compute a weighted average.\n",
        "  - It has an additional `weights` parameter, which allows you to assign a weight to each element in the array.\n",
        "  - Syntax: `np.average(a, axis=None, weights=None, returned=False)`\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Example:**\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  import numpy as np\n",
        "  arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
        "  weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2])\n",
        "  weighted_avg = np.average(arr, weights=weights)\n",
        "  print(weighted_avg)  # Output: 3.0\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Key Differences:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Default Behavior:**\n",
        "  - Both `np.mean()` and `np.average()` return the same result when no additional arguments are provided. They both compute the arithmetic mean of the array.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Weights:**\n",
        "  - **`np.mean()`**: Does not support weights. It only calculates the unweighted mean.\n",
        "  - **`np.average()`**: Supports the optional `weights` argument. If you want to compute a weighted average, you would use `np.average()` and provide a `weights` array, where each element corresponds to the weight of the corresponding value in the input array.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Handling of Weights:**\n",
        "  - When you provide weights in `np.average()`, it calculates the weighted average, where each element contributes to the mean according to its weight.\n",
        "  - In contrast, `np.mean()` will simply treat all elements equally (i.e., all weights are implicitly 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Additional Features in `np.average()`:**\n",
        "  - **`returned` argument**: This is a special feature in `np.average()`. If `returned=True`, the function will return a tuple with the weighted average and the sum of the weights. This can be useful if you need to perform further calculations based on the weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Example with `returned` argument:**\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  import numpy as np\n",
        "  arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
        "  weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2])\n",
        "  weighted_avg, weight_sum = np.average(arr, weights=weights, returned=True)\n",
        "  print(weighted_avg)  # Output: 3.0\n",
        "  print(weight_sum)    # Output: 1.0\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Performance Considerations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`np.mean()`** is faster than `np.average()` when you don't need the extra functionality that `np.average()` provides (like weights or the `returned` parameter). This is because `np.mean()` is more straightforward and optimized for the specific case of calculating the arithmetic mean without any additional logic.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **`np.average()`** introduces some additional overhead, especially when you use the `weights` or `returned` arguments, because it requires additional computations to handle the weights or return the sum of weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **When to Use One Over the Other:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use `np.mean()` when:**\n",
        "  - You only need the arithmetic mean (unweighted average) of the array.\n",
        "  - You don't need any extra functionality like weighted averages or tracking the sum of weights.\n",
        "  - You are concerned with performance and just need the simplest and fastest method for computing an average.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use `np.average()` when:**\n",
        "  - You need to compute a **weighted average** (i.e., you have weights that you want to apply to the elements of the array).\n",
        "  - You want to use the `returned` argument to retrieve both the weighted average and the sum of the weights.\n",
        "  - You require the additional functionality that `np.average()` provides beyond the plain mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Summary Table:**\n",
        "\n",
        "| Feature                  | `np.mean()`                          | `np.average()`                        |\n",

        "#### **Memory Efficiency**\n",

        "- **Fixed Size**: NumPy arrays use a fixed-size data type for all elements, meaning each element of the array occupies the same amount of memory. For example:\n",

For example, if you only need integers between 0 and 255, using `np.uint8` (which uses 1 byte per element) is much more memory-efficient than using `np.int64` (which uses 8 bytes per element).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Performance Optimization**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Faster Operations**: Smaller data types typically result in faster computations because less data needs to be processed. For example:\n",
        "  - Operations on a `np.int8` or `np.float32` array are faster than operations on a `np.int64` or `np.float64` array, as the data requires less memory bandwidth and cache space.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Vectorization**: NumPy operations are highly optimized for vectorized operations, and smaller data types allow NumPy to perform these operations more efficiently, as they can be packed into CPU registers or cache more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Precision vs. Speed**: The choice of data type also impacts the **precision** of computations. For instance:\n",
        "  - `np.float32` provides lower precision but is faster and requires less memory compared to `np.float64`, which offers higher precision but is slower and uses more memory.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  For most applications, a precision of 32-bit floats (`np.float32`) is sufficient, but for scientific computations requiring high precision, you might prefer `np.float64`.\n",

        "### 4. **Converting Data Types (Casting)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Sometimes, you may want to change the data type of an array. This is possible using the `astype()` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",

        "\n",
        "### 5. **Choosing the Right Data Type**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Memory Constraints**: If you're working with a large dataset and have memory constraints, choose the smallest appropriate data type (e.g., `np.uint8`, `np.int16`, `np.float32`).\n",

        "- **Performance**: Use smaller data types for faster processing. In machine learning tasks, using `np.float32` often provides a good balance between memory efficiency and precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding and choosing the appropriate **data type** for NumPy arrays is essential for:\n",

        "- **Precision**: Selecting the right data type also ensures that computations have the required precision without unnecessary overhead.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Definition of `ndarray` in NumPy**\n",
        "\n",
        "In NumPy, an **ndarray** (short for *n-dimensional array*) is the primary data structure used to store and manipulate numerical data. It is a multi-dimensional, homogeneous array that holds elements of the same data type and supports efficient operations. The `ndarray` is more efficient than Python's built-in data structures (such as lists) and is designed specifically for numerical computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Features of `ndarray`**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Homogeneous Data**:\n",
        "   - All elements in a NumPy array (`ndarray`) must have the same data type. This is in contrast to Python lists, which can hold elements of different types (e.g., integers, strings, floats).\n",
        "   - The homogeneous nature allows NumPy to store data more efficiently and perform operations more quickly, as the memory layout is optimized for numerical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Multi-dimensional**:\n",
        "   - An `ndarray` can be one-dimensional (like a vector), two-dimensional (like a matrix), or n-dimensional (e.g., 3D arrays, tensors, etc.). This gives it the flexibility to handle more complex data structures compared to Python lists.\n",
        "   - For example:\n",
        "     - A 1D array can represent a vector.\n",
        "     - A 2D array can represent a matrix.\n",
        "     - A 3D array can represent a multi-layer matrix or a tensor.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Fixed Size**:\n",
        "   - The size of a NumPy array is fixed when it is created. Once an `ndarray` is created, you cannot change its size. However, you can change its shape or data type, or create new arrays with different sizes.\n",
        "   - This fixed size provides significant performance benefits over Python lists, which are dynamic and can be resized during runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Efficient Memory Layout**:\n",
        "   - NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, which makes access to individual elements faster compared to Python lists. This layout allows for better memory management and cache utilization.\n",
        "   - The elements of an `ndarray` are stored in a single, contiguous memory block, as opposed to the separate, dynamically allocated blocks used in Python lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Vectorized Operations**:\n",
        "   - NumPy supports **vectorization**, which means that operations on entire arrays (e.g., element-wise operations) can be performed without the need for explicit loops. This leads to concise and highly efficient code.\n",
        "   - Vectorized operations are implemented in C and take full advantage of low-level optimizations, making them much faster than Python loops over lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Rich Functionality**:\n",
        "   - NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical and statistical operations directly on arrays, including functions for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, random number generation, and more.\n",
        "   - The ability to perform complex operations on entire arrays with a single function call or operator makes NumPy arrays extremely powerful.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Shape and Axis Management**:\n",
        "   - `ndarray` objects have an associated **shape** (a tuple representing the dimensions of the array) and **axis** labels (for multidimensional arrays). This allows for flexible reshaping, slicing, and manipulating of arrays.\n",
        "   - NumPy also supports operations like reshaping, transposing, and broadcasting that are not possible with standard Python lists.\n",

        "6. Analyze the performance benefits of NumPy arrays over Python lists for large-scale numerical operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The performance benefits of **NumPy arrays** over **Python lists** for large-scale numerical operations are substantial, primarily due to differences in **memory layout**, **data type uniformity**, **vectorization**, and **optimized implementations**. Let’s analyze these performance benefits in detail:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Memory Layout and Efficiency**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **NumPy Arrays**:\n",
        "- **Contiguous memory block**: NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous memory blocks. This allows for efficient memory access, making operations like element-wise computations faster and more cache-friendly. When accessing array elements, NumPy can load multiple elements into the CPU cache at once, reducing the overhead of accessing memory.\n",
        "- **Fixed size and type**: NumPy arrays are of a fixed size and type, which makes memory usage predictable and compact. All elements have the same data type (e.g., `int32`, `float64`), so NumPy can allocate just enough memory for the array and avoid the overhead of storing additional metadata or references (which is the case with Python lists).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Python Lists**:\n",
        "- **Non-contiguous memory**: Python lists are arrays of pointers to objects (each element is a reference to an object, which can be of any type). This results in scattered memory allocations, meaning each element may not be adjacent in memory, leading to inefficient cache utilization. Each element in a Python list has additional overhead, such as the need to store references to the objects.\n",
        "- **Dynamic sizing**: Python lists can dynamically grow and shrink, but this flexibility comes at the cost of extra memory and slower access times. Lists also support heterogeneous types (e.g., integers, floats, and strings all in the same list), which introduces additional complexity and memory overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Performance Impact**: Due to its contiguous memory layout, NumPy arrays are much more efficient in terms of both memory usage and access time compared to Python lists, especially for large arrays of numerical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Vectorization and Optimized Operations**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **NumPy Arrays**:\n",
        "- **Vectorized operations**: NumPy is designed to perform operations on entire arrays in a single operation, without the need for explicit loops. This is known as **vectorization**. Vectorized operations are implemented in **C** and make use of highly optimized low-level code, allowing NumPy to perform element-wise operations (such as addition, multiplication, etc.) at speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than pure Python loops.\n",
        "- **Broadcasting**: NumPy also supports **broadcasting**, which allows you to perform operations on arrays of different shapes without needing to manually reshape them. Broadcasting makes array operations much more flexible and efficient.\n",
        "- **Low-level optimizations**: NumPy operations are implemented in compiled C code, which is optimized for performance and can be parallelized to take advantage of multiple CPU cores or specialized hardware like GPUs in some cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Python Lists**:\n",
        "- **Loop-based operations**: Python lists require explicit loops to perform operations on individual elements. For example, adding two lists element-wise or applying a mathematical operation would require a `for` loop, which is slow in Python.\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  # Element-wise addition of two lists (Python approach)\n",
        "  list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "  list2 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n",
        "  result = [list1[i] + list2[i] for i in range(len(list1))]\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "- **Overhead in Python**: In addition to the explicit loops, each element in the list must be accessed through a reference, and Python itself adds overhead by managing the type of each element and performing dynamic type checking.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Performance Impact**: The use of vectorized operations in NumPy makes it **much faster** than using Python lists for numerical tasks, especially for large-scale operations. While Python lists require loops and are dynamically typed, NumPy's optimized C-based operations allow it to perform large-scale mathematical computations efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Memory Consumption**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **NumPy Arrays**:\n",
        "- **Efficient memory usage**: NumPy arrays are much more memory efficient because they store elements of a uniform type, which means each element takes up a fixed number of bytes (e.g., 4 bytes for `np.int32` or 8 bytes for `np.float64`). This allows NumPy to minimize memory overhead.\n",
        "- **No extra object metadata**: Since NumPy arrays are homogeneous, they do not need to store additional information for each element (such as the element’s type or reference pointers).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Python Lists**:\n",
        "- **Higher memory overhead**: Each element in a Python list is a reference to an object, which means the list contains pointers to each element, plus metadata for managing the element's type. Additionally, Python lists are dynamically resized, requiring more memory to accommodate potential growth.\n",
        "- **Heterogeneous data types**: If the list contains different data types, each element requires additional memory to store type information, which increases the memory usage even further.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Performance Impact**: NumPy's memory-efficient structure allows it to handle large datasets with much lower memory usage compared to Python lists. This efficiency is especially important when working with large-scale numerical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Example: Speed Comparison**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's compare the performance of NumPy arrays and Python lists with a simple example of performing element-wise addition:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import numpy as np\n",
        "import time\n",

        "start = time.time()\n",
        "result_list = [list1[i] + list2[i] for i in range(size)]  # Loop-based operation\n",
        "end = time.time()\n",
        "print(f\"Python list operation took {end - start:.6f} seconds\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output**:\n",
        "```\n",
        "NumPy operation took 0.052342 seconds\n",
        "Python list operation took 2.340542 seconds\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation**:\n",
        "- The **NumPy operation** completes in a fraction of the time compared to the Python list operation, even though both perform the same element-wise addition.\n",
        "- The NumPy operation is **vectorized**, meaning it performs the operation on the entire array at once, while the Python list operation relies on an explicit loop, making it much slower.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Parallelism and SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **NumPy**: NumPy can take advantage of **SIMD** (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instructions, available on most modern processors, which allows the same operation to be applied to multiple data points simultaneously. Furthermore, many NumPy functions are optimized to run in parallel on multi-core CPUs.\n",
        "- **Python Lists**: Python lists do not have any parallelism or SIMD capabilities, and performing operations on large datasets typically involves running serial Python loops, which do not take advantage of the hardware's parallel processing capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Integration with Other Libraries**\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy is often used as the foundation for other libraries that further optimize performance, such as **SciPy**, **Pandas**, **TensorFlow**, and **PyTorch**. These libraries leverage NumPy’s array structures and performance optimizations, ensuring that large-scale data operations remain fast and efficient. In contrast, Python lists are not optimized for integration with these specialized libraries.\n",

        "**Key Performance Benefits of NumPy Arrays Over Python Lists**:\n",
        "1. **Faster Operations**: Due to vectorization, low-level C implementations, and SIMD support, NumPy arrays can perform large-scale numerical operations much faster than Python lists, especially for element-wise operations.\n",
        "2. **Memory Efficiency**: NumPy arrays are much more memory-efficient because they are stored in contiguous blocks and all elements share the same type, unlike Python lists, which store pointers and can hold heterogeneous data types.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Vectorization** refers to the process of performing operations on entire arrays (or \"vectors\") at once, without the need for explicit looping over individual elements. In NumPy, this is achieved by using **element-wise operations** that apply to entire arrays or large chunks of data at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **How Vectorization Works**:\n",
        "- **Element-wise operations**: NumPy allows you to apply operations such as addition, multiplication, and comparison directly on arrays, and it will automatically apply the operation to each element of the array. This avoids the need for manually iterating over array elements with loops.\n",
        "- **Efficient use of memory and computation**: Vectorized operations are implemented in **C** and **Fortran**, providing much better performance than the equivalent Python loops. This is because NumPy arrays are contiguous blocks of memory, and the operations are optimized at a lower level to work directly with this memory, without the overhead of Python's loops or function calls.\n",

It enables NumPy to automatically **align** arrays with different shapes for element-wise operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **How Broadcasting Works**:\n",
        "When performing operations between arrays, NumPy will attempt to **broadcast** the smaller array across the larger one so that they have compatible shapes. The rules of broadcasting ensure that arrays can be operated on together without needing to explicitly reshape them.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Broadcasting Rules**:\n",
        "The broadcasting rules are applied as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **If the arrays have a different number of dimensions**, NumPy will **pad the smaller array's shape** with ones on the left (higher dimensions).\n",
        "2. **Arrays are compatible when**:\n",
        "   - The size of the dimensions are either **equal** or one of them is `1`.\n",
        "3. **Broadcasting behavior**:\n",
        "   - The dimension of size `1` in the smaller array is \"stretched\" to match the corresponding dimension of the larger array.\n",
