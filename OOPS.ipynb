        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**: This concept involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called an object. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps protect the integrity of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. This allows programmers to interact with an object at a high level without needing to understand all the intricacies of its inner workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**: This concept allows a new class (child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (parent or superclass). Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, allowing methods to perform differently based on the objectâ€™s actual class. This can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Composition**: Composition involves creating complex types by combining objects of other types. This relationship allows for building more complex structures while promoting code reusability and flexibility, as the composed objects can be changed independently of the container object.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts work together to facilitate better organization, modularity, and maintainability in software development."

        "### Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Decorator Definition**:\n",
        "   - The `execution_time_decorator` function takes another function `func` as an argument.\n",
        "   - Inside, it defines a nested `wrapper` function that will replace the original function.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Measuring Execution Time**:\n",
        "   - The `start_time` is recorded just before the function is called.\n",
        "   - After the function executes, the `end_time` is recorded.\n",
        "   - The difference between `end_time` and `start_time` gives the execution time.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Calling the Original Function**:\n",
        "   - The original function is called with `*args` and `**kwargs` to ensure that it can accept any number of positional and keyword arguments.\n",
        "   - The result of the function call is stored and returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Applying the Decorator**:\n",
        "   - The `@execution_time_decorator` syntax is used to apply the decorator to the `sample_function`. This replaces `sample_function` with the `wrapper` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Example Usage**:\n",
        "   - When you call `sample_function(1000000)`, the decorator measures the time it takes to execute the loop and prints it.\n",
        "\n",
        "This implementation allows you to easily measure and print the execution time of any function by simply decorating it with `@execution_time_decorator`."

        "\n",
        "Python uses the **C3 Linearization** algorithm (also known as **C3 superclass linearization**) to resolve the Diamond Problem. This method creates a linear order of classes that maintains the following properties:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Preserves the Order of Inheritance**: The order of base classes is preserved as specified in the class definition.\n",
        "2. **Maintains the Local Precedence**: If a class is a base class for another class, it appears before that class in the linearization.\n",
        "3. **No Duplicates**: Each class appears only once in the resolution order.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of the Diamond Problem in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example that demonstrates how Python resolves the Diamond Problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    def greet(self):\n",
        "        return \"Hello from A\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class B(A):\n",
        "    def greet(self):\n",
        "        return \"Hello from B\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class C(A):\n",
        "    def greet(self):\n",
        "        return \"Hello from C\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class D(B, C):\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example usage\n",
        "d = D()\n",
        "print(d.greet())  # Output: Hello from B\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation of the Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Class Definitions**:\n",
        "   - Class `A` has a `greet` method.\n",
        "   - Classes `B` and `C` override this method.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Class `D`**:\n",
        "   - Inherits from both `B` and `C`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Method Resolution**:\n",
        "   - When `d.greet()` is called, Python follows the MRO (Method Resolution Order).\n",
        "   - The MRO for class `D` can be viewed using `D.mro()`, which will yield:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     [<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>]\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - Python checks the MRO in the order of classes and finds the `greet` method in `B` first, so it calls that method.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Diamond Problem occurs in multiple inheritance when two classes inherit from a common base class, creating ambiguity in method resolution.\n",
        "- Python resolves this problem using the C3 Linearization algorithm, which provides a consistent and predictable method resolution order, ensuring that the method of the first parent class in the inheritance list is used. This approach helps avoid ambiguity and maintains clarity in class hierarchies."
